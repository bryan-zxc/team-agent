## The Monsters

**Zimomo** — The calm, authoritative leader of The Monsters tribe and the only male among them. With his distinctive spiked tail and imposing stature (twice the size of Labubu), Zimomo watches over the group like a protective patriarch — often compared to Papa Smurf. He has a serious, composed presence and guides the tribe through their Nordic-inspired adventures, corralling the chaos of his more playful companions.

**Labubu** — The mischievous protagonist and face of the franchise. A bright, adventurous elf girl with a wide jagged-teeth smile, pointed ears, and a slim, active silhouette. She loves pulling pranks (especially on her boyfriend Tycoco) and diving headfirst into trouble. Labubu is not one character but represents a whole species of naughty, curious elf girls — though she is the most recognisable of them all.

**Mokoko** — Rare and special even among the Labubu elves, Mokoko's name means "special" in Elvish. She has pastel pink fur, a white belly, a heart-shaped nose, and curly eyelashes. More elusive than the others, she radiates a dreamy charm heightened by her ability to mysteriously vanish. She appears selectively and is considered the most precious of the tribe.

**Tycoco** — A petite, spooky-cute vegetarian skeleton who is Labubu's boyfriend and Vos's cousin. Despite his skeletal appearance, Tycoco has a shy, gentle soul and is the good-natured target of Labubu's endless pranks. He is quieter than his girlfriend and stands out from the tribe with his less devilish, more tender demeanour.

**Spooky** — The most mysterious of all The Monsters, Spooky only appears at night or under the moonlight. A ghostly figure with a head resembling bundled cloth, he has a calm, soft nature and appears as a friend to those in need. He does not partake in the tribe's mischievous antics, preferring to sit back and observe from the shadows.

**Pato** — The dreamiest and most laid-back of The Monsters, Pato is the tribe's resident humourist. With his duck-like appearance, slightly blurred expression, and pale pink fur, he moves at a slower pace than the rest. Rarely seen, he drifts through the world with a gentle, comical energy.

**Pippo** — A gentle, panda-like character with cute round ears and a chubby body. Pippo is the tribe's healer — his warm, calming presence makes everyone around him feel at ease. He stands a little taller than the rest and is known as a lively winemaker and social connector who brings friends together.

**Vos** — A fox spirit with a long, thin face, erect ears, and sharp eyes. Wise and mysterious, Vos serves as a guide within the tribe, drawing from Norse mythology and fairy legends. He is Tycoco's cousin and is said to be smart and perceptive, though he may harbour hidden motives beneath his helpful exterior.

**Yaya** — A fashionable, mischievous imp with a devilish grin and a cat-like silhouette. Yaya brings chaos and unpredictability to every situation, enjoying the darker side of playful antics. She is calculated and intelligent in her pranks, with a love for exploring — despite having a terrible sense of direction.

**Puca** — A quiet, forest-dwelling creature that resembles a half-fawn with small horns. Puca is a spirit of the woodland who lives among nature near Labubu's favourite hangout spots. A background supporter rather than an active participant, Puca symbolises nature itself — calm, watchful, and always present.

## Other Pop Mart Characters

**Molly** — Created by Hong Kong artist Kenny Wong in 2006, Molly is a stubborn, proud little girl with big emerald-green eyes and pouting lips. She loves to daydream, often has weird and interesting thoughts, and is both cute and arrogant. Born from Wong's observation of modern girls in society, she represents determination, dreams, and silent strength. She originally wore a beret and artist's apron, a tiny painter brought to life.

**SkullPanda** — A universal symbiont who travels freely between galactic systems, taking on different lives and personalities as she flutters across universes. With goth makeup, face piercings, and oversized streetwear silhouettes, SkullPanda embodies cool underground fashion energy. Each series explores a different dimension of her existence, making her endlessly reinventable.

**Dimoo** — A shy, introverted little boy who struggles with confusion in the real world but transforms into a brave, curious adventurer when he falls asleep. In his dreams, he enters Dimoo World — a mysterious magical realm where his true self emerges. His story captures the tension between waking timidity and the boundless courage of the dreaming mind.

**Crybaby** — A character with an ever-present crying expression who redefines tears as courage rather than weakness. Crybaby faces every situation head-on, with crying as an act of bravery and emotional honesty. Created by Thai artist Molly, the character's explosive popularity reflects a generation that values vulnerability as strength.

**Hirono** — A melancholy, introspective boy created by Chinese artist Lang, inspired by his newborn child and his own struggles as a lonely newcomer in Beijing. Hirono lives between dreams and reality, wandering through quiet forests and surreal scenes. He never speaks — his story is told entirely through posture, costume, and environment, giving others freedom to interpret his emotional world. His signature look includes a cardboard box on his head.

**Hacipupu** — Sweet, shy, and quietly imaginative, Hacipupu is a gentle little boy with a vivid inner world where stuffed animals have names, the forest hums with friendly creatures, and every moment is a quiet adventure waiting to unfold. His softness and warmth make him an instant comfort character.

**Pucky** — An ethereal forest spirit created by the artist of the same name. Pucky's world has an escapist quality — from enchanted forests to dim sum dumplings — that speaks to inner child energy and the yearning for wonder. Cute on the surface but with a tinge of darkness underneath, Pucky brings you into the spirit world where nature is to be respected, or else.

**Kubo** — A fashion-forward urban character launched in 2023 who has attracted fans with his changeable attitude towards life and style. Kubo's designs are inspired by various roles in modern city life — skateboarders, artists, lifeguards — making him a chameleon who adapts to every environment while maintaining his cool.

**Twinkle Twinkle** — An ensemble of optimistic star elves created by illustrators Da Xin and A Li, born from the philosophy "stars can't shine without darkness." With rosy faces that look like happy children and shy adults, these little glowing figures are cute and stubborn with a touch of clumsiness. Each carries a suitcase of Earth's memories, facing life's challenges with a smile and the belief that "it's no big deal."
